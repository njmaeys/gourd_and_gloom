/*
- Make it clearer that you can interact with things. 
	- Pop up that says "E" or "Mouse" (I could reuse the speech indicator)
	- Cauldron is super important here. It needs to be very evident to click the cauldron

- It's not clear that the inventory is supposed to be put into the cauldron
	
- Space bar as an option to speed through text instead of just click?
