////////////////// STORY //////////////////
/*
End of day 1
	- Current end should now set a new quest line for the player to "go to bed"
	- Force them down the trap door (need to make) then play a click noise of a lock closing
		- If the player tries to use the ladder it is locked and they cannot get out
		- Once they go to bed then do a scene transition with some words
			- ... Why did she lock me in here? ...
			- ... Did I do something wrong? ...
		
	- Set the new round of requests and have two things also happen
		- In the woods trigger the prompt for "Help" which will take them to the Miner who is trapped and has the pickaxe
		- Tell the player that they must collect some rabbits feet
			- Open up the carrot mini game
			- Spawn some rabbits in the woods and have them "run away" until the player places a carrot on the ground
				- Make this a simple prompt and interaction
				- Start the idea of "Has new thought?" or some shit on the player with ? pop up

////////////////// QOL //////////////////
/*
- With persistent objects in the menu room I need to have a reset function that set's everything to baseline

- Make it clearer that you can interact with things. 
	- Pop up that says "E" or "Mouse" (I could reuse the speech indicator)
	- Cauldron is super important here. It needs to be very evident to click the cauldron

- It's not clear that the inventory is supposed to be put into the cauldron
	
- Space bar as an option to speed through text instead of just click?
