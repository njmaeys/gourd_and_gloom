// THIS IS ONLY FOR NOTES AND IDEAS

////////////////// QOL //////////////////
/*
- Make it clearer that you can interact with things. 
	- Pop up that says "E" or "Mouse" (I could reuse the speech indicator)
	- Cauldron is super important here. It needs to be very evident to click the cauldron

- [DONE} Exterior doorways could be better served as a click instead of the zone change

- It's not clear that the inventory is supposed to be put into the cauldron
	
- [DONE] Movement to leave the desk/book. Anything that is interactable make it possible to walk away

- Space bar as an option to speed through text instead of just click?

- Remove the ability to load the cauldron with TAB?
	- Maybe only allow it on click of the actual cauldron itself
*/

////////////////// Visual //////////////////
/*
- [DONE] Move the witch a bit away from the wall

- [DONE] Walking feels "floaty" maybe animation speed up would fix it

- Show certain text (important bits) in different colors

- [DONE] Stairs don't look like stairs
*/

////////////////// Sounds //////////////////
/*
- [DONE] Menu sounds when clicking a button

- [DONE] Door entrance and exit sounds

- [NOPE] (tried it, didn't like it)] Grass sound when walking through

////////////////// Mini Games at Garden //////////////////
/*
- Sunflowers
	- Simon says. Need to get 12 total for perfect, 2 per (6 sunflowers at most)

- Carrots
	6 lines of rabbits running down to get the carrot. 
	The player must click the rabbits for x amount of time to keep them at bay
