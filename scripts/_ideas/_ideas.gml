Do next


Day 2

- NOTE 
	- Before doing anything else, fix the prompt that brings up the ptoion when
	clicking on the bookcase
		- I think the issue is proximity

- Carrot work in progress
	- Use the player interaction prompts to drop the carrot
	- Figure out how to get the rabbits to come back and eat the carrot
	- Allow the player to then click on the rabbit and get the needed stuff
		- Have to decide if i'm going to make a morale decision here or not



- Set up the hook for getting further into the woods
	- Ultimately this is to get the pickaxe for opening the cave entrance
		- Some sort of similar mini game pop up to release someone/thing that is trapped under a fallen bolder 
			-... IDK flesh this out

/*
- With persistent objects in the menu room I need to have a reset function that set's everything to baseline

- Potions need to not show up unless interacting with the book shelves
