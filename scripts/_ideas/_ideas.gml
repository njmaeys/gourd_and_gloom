Do next


Day 2

- Begin working on how to interact and collect from the rabbits in the forest 
	- Do I want to make this the starting point of options?
		- Capture the rabbit or pet the rabbit...
			- IDK what this really differs in

- Set up the hook for getting further into the woods
	- Ultimately this is to get the pickaxe for opening the cave entrance
		- Some sort of similar mini game pop up to release someone/thing that is trapped under a fallen bolder 
			-... IDK flesh this out

/*
- With persistent objects in the menu room I need to have a reset function that set's everything to baseline

- Potions need to not show up unless interacting with the book shelves
